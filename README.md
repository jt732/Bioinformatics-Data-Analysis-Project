# Bioinformatics-Data-Analysis-Project

Our project investigates the molecular effects of Nitrogen Mustard (NM) and Phenylarsine Oxide (PAO) on skin injury. First, we labeled tissue slide samples based on their corresponding treatments. We then applied the Spatial Transcriptomics method to generate gene expression data for cells within each slide while retaining their spatial context. Following this, we used unsupervised clustering and Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD) to classify each cell type. By comparing the classification results from both methods and integrating them, we obtained a final classification, successfully grouping fibroblasts together, IFE/HF keratinocytes into their respective groups, and immune cells into general areas. We further analyzed the results, creating various plots to illustrate changes in cell type composition and gene expression levels after treatment. Notably, we observed shifts in skin cell composition and upregulation of neutrophil-related genes following NM treatment.
